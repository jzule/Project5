            My name is Juan Zuleta. On this page you will get to know a little
            about me and my web developement journey. This page currently has
            two sections, one is about my life and the other is about my coding
            life.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <br />
          <p tabindex="0">
            I was born in Medellin, Colombia and raised in Miramar, Florida. I
            am currently working at Amazon as a warehouse associate. I graduated
            from Florida International University with a bachelor's in IT. I am
            one of the very few people in my family that managed to get a
            degree.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>

          <p tabindex="0">
            My journey on becoming a web developer has been very fun so far.
            Thanks to my time at school I do have some experience in HTML and
            CSS. I am currently enrolled in Correlation One's web developement
            training. So far it has been very helpful due to the fact that they
            go in depth in the web developement field compared to the very broad
            teachings back in school. With my education level and my experience
            with Correlation One I believe becoming a front end web developer is
            a very achievable goal.
